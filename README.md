## 🚀 About Me

I'm a cloud engineering enthusiast currently pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Records Management & Information Technology at Kenyatta University. My journey in tech is driven by a deep curiosity for cloud technologies, automation, and building robust infrastructure solutions. I specialize in AWS services, Linux systems, and DevOps practices, with hands-on experience in networking and Python development.

When I'm not architecting cloud solutions, you'll find me exploring new DevOps tools, contributing to open-source projects, or learning about the latest trends in cloud security and automation.
